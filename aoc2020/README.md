# Advent of Code

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) attempts.
Formats vary by year.

## 2020

### Rust

Both [`cargo-aoc`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-aoc) and manual running will work with this year's binaries.
If you want to run manually, do `cargo run [--release] -- <dir containing your dayX.txt input files>`.
