# Advent of Code

My repo for my annual solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), or as far as I get with them.
I typically work in python and rust, other languages I'm interested in might appear in places.

## 2020

### Rust

Both [`cargo-aoc`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-aoc) and manual running will work with this year's binaries.
If you want to run manually, do:

```
cargo run [--release] -- <dir containing your dayX.txt input files>
```

Tests are available under `cargo test`, and benchmarks can be run with the `cargo-aoc` tool.
